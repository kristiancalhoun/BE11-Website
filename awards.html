			<p>The following awards will be earned by teams competing at Brunswick Eruption 11:</p>
			<!--
			<h4><a href="http://be.raiderrobotix.org/empower.html">Project Empower Pitch Competition Winner</a></h4>
			<div class="description">
				New for this year, Team 25 is working with <a href="http://www.proempower.org/" target="_blank">Project Empower</a> to
				offer a new business/marketing oriented competition at Brunswick Eruption! 
				
				Small groups of students from each FRC team will be asked to present their team's five-minute pitch to a
				panel of Project Empower judges, who will be role-playing as potential investors/sponsors. The judges will
				provide feedback to teams on their business analysis as well as ways they can improve their robotics
				pitch and intertwine business principles within their already established engineering ones.
				Project Empower will award the winning team with a $1000 sponsorship, and also
				mentor them for a year on how to best implement their business strategies to promote
				a sustainable team. For more details about this award, <a href="http://be.raiderrobotix.org/empower.html">click here</a>.
			</div>
			-->
			<h4><a href="http://be.raiderrobotix.org/alohaaward.html">Aloha Award</a></h4>
			<div class="description">
				The Aloha Award is a fun, interactive scavenger hunt with a FIRST twist.
				Teams will be provided with a set of objectives and earn points for each 
				task they complete. The challenges are designed to allow
				teams to grow as a group and show their own team spirit
				by spreading the word of FIRST culture in their
				communities and at Brunswick Eruption. A full list of this year's Aloha Award
				tasks can be found <a href="http://be.raiderrobotix.org/alohaaward.html">here</a>.
			</div>
			
			<h4>Shoe Drive Champion</h4>
			<div class="description">
				Also new for this year, Team 25 has partnered with <a href="http://shoeboxrecycling.com/" target="_blank">ShoeBox Recycling</a>
				and will be holding a shoe drive in addition to the food drive. Teams
				are asked to bring used/unwanted pairs of shoes to be recycled. Any shoes will be accepted.
				The shoes can be dirty, just not wet or mildewed. The team that donates the most pairs of used
				shoes will win this new Tiki!
			</div>
			
			<h4>Food Drive Champion</h4>
			<div class="description">
				FIRST teams thrive because of the support from their community. In an effort to give
				something back, Brunswick Eruption supports the local community by running a food drive
				for those in need. Contributions are made to the North Brunswick Food Bank. The team who
				donates the most amount of food wins this award.
			</div>
			
			<h4><a href="http://be.raiderrobotix.org/mikewade.html">Mike Wade Memorial Award</a></h4>
			<div class="description">
				Mike Wade of NASA Goddard was a longtime friend of FIRST and responsible for the growth
				of many off-season competitions in the northeast. Mike Wade represented hard work,
				persistence and ruthless dedication. This award will honor a mentor that embodies these
				same characteristics. To be eligible, teams must submit an essay of less than 600 words
				explaining how their chosen mentor goes above and beyond the call of duty for their
				team. <a href="http://be.raiderrobotix.org/mikewade.html">Submit your nomination here</a>. 
				Nominations are due by <strong>Saturday, October 27th</strong>.
			</div>
			
			<h4>Gracious Professionalism "Mahalo" Award</h4>
			<div class="description">
			Gracious Professionalism, or GP, is one of distinguishing pillars of the FIRST Robotics
			Competition. Dr. Woodie Flowers, who first coined the term, describes it as, “a way of
			doing things that encourages high-quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and
			respects individuals and the community.” At the start of the competition, each team 
			in attendance will receive a GP Award nomination form in their pit. Teams will be asked
			to record a specific act of Gracious Professionalism performed by another team. The winner of this award
			will be the team whose nomination stood out to our panel of judges.
			</div>
			
			<h4>Smart Play Award In Honor of Dave Beck</h4>
			<div class="description">
			The “Don’t Be A Bobo” Smart Play Award is presented in honor of the late Dave Beck, a
			mentor on Team 103 and an extremely close friend of Team 25. Dave taught us that being
			creative and using ingenious methods is oftentimes more important than the robot itself.
			As such, this award is given to the team whose unique strategy and smart play on the
			field during the qualification matches stood out above the rest.
			</div>
				
			<h4>Evil Sundae Survivor</h4>
			<div class="description">
				An Evil Sundae is ice-cream mixed with some, shall we say, "non-traditional"
				ingredients that change every year. Each team attending Brunswick Eruption will
				nominate one team member
				to participate in this contest. The goal? To eat, and keep down, the sundae in the
				fastest time possible. Each participant is allowed to bring a spoon of their
				choosing to use in conquering this evil dessert——we provide the barf bags.
				Participation in this contest is purely at the participants risk and we take
				absolutely no responsibility!
			</div>
			
			<h4>Best Autonomous Mode</h4>
			<div class="description">
			This award is given to the team with the most effective, reliable, or unique autonomous
			mode. Have you forgotten the amount of work that went into programming your robot?
			Maybe. But we did not. We'll pay attention to your autonomous mode and give it the
			respect it deserves!
			</div>
			
			<h4>Best Balancer Award</h4>
			<div class="description">
			The bridges on this year's field provided an exciting and dynamic end game component to Rebound
			Rumble. The Best Balancer Award honors the team who mastered the art of balancing by
			balancing on either the Coopertition or Alliance bridge the most times throughout the
			qualification rounds. 
			</div>
			
			<h4>Future Glory Award</h4>
			<div class="description">
				One of the primary goals of Brunswick Eruption since its inception has been to grow
				FIRST within the region. The first pre-rookie team competed at BE in 2004 and many
				have successfully followed in their path since, gaining exposure to FIRST and
				experiencing a competition in full before their inaugural FRC season. The Future Glory
				Award recognizes one of this year's outstanding pre-rookie teams.
			</div>
			
			<h4>BE 11 Finalist</h4>
			<div class="description">
				This award celebrates the alliance that makes it to the final match of the competition.
			</div>
			
			<h4>BE 11 Champions</h4>
			<div class="description">
				This award celebrates the alliance that wins the final match of the competition.
			</div>
			
			<h4>Big Kahuna</h4>
			<div class="description">
			Raider Robotix and Brunswick Eruption are run efficiently due to our dedicated and
			hardworking volunteers / parents. This award recognizes the year-round commitment of a
			volunteer that goes above and beyond their usual responsibilities for the team.
